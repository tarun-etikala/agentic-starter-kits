"""Reliability (pass@k) evals for the LangGraph React agent.

Runs the same query multiple times to measure consistency. An agent
that passes once but fails intermittently is brittle and not
production-ready. We use k=8 as specified in the project thresholds.

NOTE: Queries run sequentially, not concurrently. Concurrent requests
to local Ollama overwhelm the model and cause timeouts, which measures
infrastructure limits rather than agent reliability.
