"""Tool usage evals for the Langflow Simple Tool Calling agent.

Validates that the agent selects, calls, and uses tools correctly
for various query types. The agent has three tools:
  get_forecast   — Open-Meteo weather API
  search_parks   — NPS park search API
  park_alerts    — NPS park alerts API

Tool calls are extracted from the Langflow /api/v1/run response
content_blocks by the harness runner — no MLflow enrichment needed.
